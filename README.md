### Hello!

I am a researcher working on solar resource assessment :sun_behind_small_cloud: and PV performance modeling :zap:.

Most of what I do involves solar energy research and python; for example, the best practice guide [AssessingSolar.org](https://assessingsolar.org).

I am also the main developer behind the [SolarStations.org](https://solarstations.org) database, the python package [twoaxistracking](https://twoaxistracking.readthedocs.io/), and am a co-maintainer of the solar energy systems modeling software [pvlib](http://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io).

If you want to know more, check out my blog [PredictablySunny.com](https://predictablysunny.com).
