### Hello!

I am a researcher working on solar resource assessment :sun_behind_small_cloud: and modeling of solar energy systems :zap:.

Much of what I do combines solar energy and python; for example, the best practice guide [AssessingSolar.org](https://assessingsolar.org).

I'm also behind the website [SolarStations.org](https://solarstations.org), the library [twoaxistracking](https://twoaxistracking.readthedocs.io/), and a co-maintainer of [pvlib](http://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io).

You can read more about me on my blog, [PredictablySunny.com](https://predictablysunny.com).
